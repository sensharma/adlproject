in this. 
2. adlproj_base_exp.ipynb: Reproducibility experiment
3. adlproj_transf_lrn.ipynb: Training ResNet for transfer learning
4. adlproj_adv_attack.ipynb: Conducting and saving adversarial attack examples
5. adlproj_captum_exps.ipynb: Using Captum to score adversarial attacks and attempts 
applied on scoring transfer learning

Additional saved models, plots and scores in respective directories.
